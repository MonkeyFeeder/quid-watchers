## Quid Watcher's Readme


### Intro

- Ever since I moved to the UK, I've tried to focus on budgetting more, YNAB doesn't support French banks ( or at least not the one I use ), and I use Bankin' more for getting a recap of my accounts everyday.
- I'm a React developer, I'm unemployed, so I thought let's go for it, and I built a budget tracker

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- The idea around the unique URL to access your content is from one of those "Everytime you build a Todo list, a puppy dies" kind of article. One of project was ironically a Todo list with a unique URL for each list. 
- I like charts, I want to budget, and my main motivation is seeing my debts go down, and my savings go up.
- It's the 2nd project on which I focus on the design. It is meant to be used on a desktop computer, not on a smartphone. I'll make it responsive, but for now it's mostly optimized for dekstops.

### How to use ?

- Go to https://quid-watchers-4eslcitp1.vercel.app/
- Type in the name you want for your budget tracker
- Bookmark the link that is given to you ( super important, unless you want to spend your whole time going to your browser history )
- ???
- Profit

### TODO

- There's nothing planned at the moment, I consider it finished, though some new features can be developed if people ask for a specific feature ( I'm so popular I'm overwhelmed by all the messages I receive ), or if I feel like there's something missing.
